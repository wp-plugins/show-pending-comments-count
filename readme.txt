Display the pending comments count next to the approved comments count in the admin listing of posts.

== Description ==

Display the pending comments count next to the approved comments count in the admin listing of posts.

By default, in the admin listing of posts, each post has its count of approved comments displayed with a word bubble background.  If you hover over a comment count, the tooltip hover text indicates the number of pending comments.  This plugin utilizes JavaScript to change the post listings so that the pending comments count is displayed next to the approved comments count inside the same word bubble (though with a separator).

The pending comments count will appear next to post comment counts in:

* The "Edit Posts" listing of posts
* The "Edit Pages" listing of pages
* The "Edit Comments" listing of comments

This plugin will only function for users in the admin who have JavaScript enabled.


== Installation ==

1. Unzip `show-pending-comments-count.zip` inside the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory for your site
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' admin menu in WordPress

== Screenshots ==

1. A screenshot of the 'Edit Posts' admin page with the plugin active, showing a post without pending comments and one with pending comments.
